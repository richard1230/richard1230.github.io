#### Description:

> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
> You may assume that each input would have ***exactly one solution***, and you may ***not use the same element twice***.
> You can return the answer in any order.

#### Thinking:

```javascript
const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  // create an  Object Dictionary
  const exsitedHash = {}

  //loop through the array 'nums'ï¼Œwe need to store the index of nums as the value and the num as the key in the Object Dictionary
  
  for (const [index, num] of nums.entries()) {
    //check if the curremt item in the Object Dictionary has a value(the index in the nums)
    
    // if the value(the index in the nums) exists, it means current item has a previous counterpart, their sum is equalto the target,
    // we can return the value(the index in the nums) of current item in the Object Dictionary and the index of previous counterpart item in the nums array
   
    // if the vlaue(the index in the nums) is not exist, store the value(the index in the nums)
    
    if (exsitedHash[num] !== undefined) {
      return [exsitedHash[num], index]
    }else{
      existedHash[num]=index
    }
  }
}
