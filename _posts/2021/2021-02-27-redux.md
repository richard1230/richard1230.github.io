- Good for managing large state
- Useful for sharing data between components
- Predictable state management using the 3 principles
    - Single source of truth
    - State is read only
    - Changes using pure functions

### Redux Terms and Concepts
### 1. React-Redux
- Redux can integrate with any UI framework, and is most frequently used with React. ***React-Redux*** is our official package that lets your React components interact with with a Redux store by reading pieces of state and dispatching actions to update the store.

### 2. Immutability
- "Mutable" means "changeable". If something is "immutable", it can never be changed.

### 3. Update values immutably
- In order to update values immutably, your code must make copies of existing objects/arrays, and then modify the copies.
- We can do this by hand using JavaScript's array / object spread operators, as well as array methods that return new copies of the array instead of mutating the original array:


```javascript
  const obj = {
    // To safely update obj.a.c, we have to copy each piece
    a: {c:3}, b:2
  }

  const obj2 = {
    //copy obj  /overwrite a / copy obj.a / overwrite c
    ...obj,     a:{          ...obj.a,         c:42}
  }
```

- Redux expects that all state updates are done immutably.

### 4. Actions
- An action is a plain Javascript object that has a **type** field. You can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application.
- The **type** field should be a string that gives this action a descriptive name, like "todos/todoAdded". We usually write that types sting like "domain/eventName", where the first part is the feature or category that this action belongs to, and the second part is the specific thing that happened.
- An action object can have other fields with additional information about **what happened**. By convention, we put that information in a field called payload.
- A typical action object might look like this:
  ```javascript
    const addTodoAction = {
      type: 'todos/todoAdded',
      payload: 'Buy milk'
      }
  ```
### 5. Action Creator
- An **action creator** is a function that creates and returns an action object. We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time.
  ```javascript
    const addTodo = text => {
      return {
        type: 'todos/todoAdded',
        payload: text
      }
    }
  ```

### 6. Reducers
- A reducer is a function that receives the current **state** and an **action** object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state: **(state, action) => newState** You can think of a reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action (event) type.
- Reducers must always follow some specific rules:
    - They should only calculate the new state value based on the **state** and **action** arguments.
    - They are not allowed to modify the existing **state**. Instead, they must make immutable updates, by coping the existing **state** and making changes to the copied values.
    - They must not do any asynchronous logic, calculate random values, or cause other "side effects"
- The logic inside reducer functions typically follows the same series of steps:
    - Check to see if the reducer cares about this action
        - If so, make a copy of the state, update the copy with new values, and return it.
    - Otherwise, return of a reducer, showing the steps that each reducer should follow:

  ```javascript
    const initialState = {value: 0}
    function counterReducer(state=initialState, action){
      // check to see if the reducer cares about this action
      if(action.type === 'counter/increment'){
        // if so, make a copy of 'state'
        return {
          ...state,
          // and update the copy with the new value
          value: state.value +1
        }
      }
      // otherwise return the existing state unchanged
      return state
    }
  ```


- A redux reducer function is exactly the same idea as this "reduce callback" function!
- We can say that Redux reducers reduce a set of actions (over time) into a single state.


### 7. Store
- The current Redux application ***state*** lives in an object called the *store*
- The store is created by passing in a reducer, and has a method called **getState** that returns the current state value:
```javascript
   import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
   const store = configureStore({reducer: counterReducer })
   console.log(store.getState())
   // {value: 0}
```

### 8. Dispatch
- The Redux store has a method called **dispatch**. The only way to update the state is to call **store.dispatch()** and pass in an action object. The store will run its reducer function and save the new state value inside, and we can call **getState()** to retrieve the updated value:
```javascript
  store.dispatch({type: 'counter/increment'})
  console.log(store.getState())
  // {value:1}
```
- You can think of dispatching actions as "triggering an event" in the application. Something happened, and we want the store to know about it. Reducers act like event listeners, and when they hear an action they are interested in, they update the state in response.
- We typically call action creators to dispatch the right action:
  ```javascript
     const increment = () => {
       return {
         type: 'counter/increment'
       }
     }

     store.dispatch(increment())
     console.log(store.getState())
     // {value: 2}
  ```

  ### Summary
    - #### Redux is a library for managing global application state
        - Redux is typically used with the React-Redux library for integrating Redux and React together
        - Redux Toolkit is the recommended way to write Redux logic
    - #### Redux uses a "one-way data flow" app structure
        - State describes the condition of the app at a point in time, and UI render based on that state
        - When something happens in the app"
            - The UI dispatches an action
            - The store runs the reducers and the state is updated based on what occurred
            - The store notifies the UI that the state has changed
        - The UI re-renders based on the new state
    - Redux uses serval types of code
        - Actions are plain objects with a **type** field, and describe "what happened" in the app
        - Reducers are functions that calculate a new state value based on previous state + an action
        - A redux store runs the root reducer whenever an action is dispatched
