### 一些关键点

1. Always remember the keyboard and contrast accessibility
2. Stop trying to rate your own skills.
    * You don’t know the skill at all
    * You’re still learning the skill
    * You feel confident in the skill
3. You only need to tell them what you’re learning and what you feel confident in.
4. Write your CSS written mobile-first, mobile responsive is quite important.
5. Show me the code, and the live site. 
6. Tell me what you’ve actually contributed to.
7. Prove you don’t need Bootstrap or jQuery
8. Speak towards your dream job.
